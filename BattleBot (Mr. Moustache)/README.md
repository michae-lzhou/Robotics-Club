### Summary
As much as the standings of the tournament may disagree, this BattleBot, Mr. Moustache, is a warrior-at-heart. We were tasked to create a BattleBot and compete with fellow BattleBot groups during a tournament. There were many safety checks to pass, and we attended many workshops to get the robot parts from designed to assembled. Overall, it was a very pleasant experience to work with my team and put something together from scratch in a just a couple of weeks.

### What Worked
The designing part of the project went smoothly, and the CADing of the individual parts were extremely detailed and accounted for many issues that we could've ran into.

### What Didn't Work
The robot was extremely not cooperative, as we had many issues with the battery pack —— accidentally cut the wire on a sharp edge, shorting a brand new battery, and extremely low battery. All of these issues contributed to our delayed start of the BattleBots event. Furthermore, the robot was not moving properly, and kept hesitating because the motor attachment came loose at the last second before the match.
